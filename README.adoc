Provides (mainly) two classes to help with EditingSupport in JFace: TextEditingSupport and ComboBoxEditingSupport. Both classes provide typed-equivalents to the Object-based JFace approach, through generics.

See the javadoc for both classes, and see the class JFace for easier usage of those classes in a ColumnViewer.

API is _not_ stable. Comments and bug reports are welcome.
